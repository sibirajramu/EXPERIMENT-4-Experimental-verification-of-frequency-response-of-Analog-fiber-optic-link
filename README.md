## THEORY

Fiber optic links can be used for transmission of digital as well as analog signals. A fiber optic link typically consists of three main elements:
- **Transmitter**: Converts the electrical input signal into optical (light) energy.
- **Optical Fiber**: Serves as the transmission medium for the light signal.
- **Receiver**: Converts the received light back into an electrical signal, preserving the original signal pattern.

## PROCEDURE

1. Connect the power supply to the board.  
2. Ensure that all switched faults are set to ‘Off’.  
3. Make the following connections (as shown in Figure 19):  
   a. Connect the 1KHz sine wave output to emitter 1's input.  
   b. Connect the fiber optic cable between emitter output and detector input.  
   c. Connect detector 1's output to AC amplifier 1 input.  
4. On the board, switch emitter 1's driver to analog mode.  
5. Switch on the power.  
6. Observe the input to emitter 1 (TP5) and the output from AC amplifier 1 (TP28). Verify that both signals are identical.  
7. Vary the frequency between 10 Hz to 1 MHz and observe the output voltage for a constant input voltage of 5V.  
8. Calculate the bandwidth by determining the gain in decibels (dB).
